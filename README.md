### Project Title
Bike Share Udacity Project

### Description
This program asks for user input to decide on what city (out of Chicago, Washington, and New York), month (from January to June, or all months), and day of the week the user wants to see data for. When the city, month, and day are inputed and accepted, the program will then show the following details:

	- Most popular month
	- Most popular day
	- Most popular hour of the day
	- Most popular start station
	- Most popular end station
	- Most popular combination of start and end station
	- Total trip durations
	- Average trip durations 
	- Types of users 
	- The genders of the users (only available for New York and Chicago)
	- The oldest user and the youngest user
	- The most common birth year of the users

Every 5 lines of data given, the user will be prompted if they wish to see more or not. This will get this prompt until there is no more data or until the user days no. Then they will be asked of they wish to restart the program or not. 

### Files used
The files chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv are used to pull the bike share data for the city in which the data is named after. The washington.csv does not include any gender or birth year data. All of these were provided by Udacity.
